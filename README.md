# Planet Gravity Game

## About This Project

Planet Gravity Game is a 2D multiplayer game developed in Java using the Swing library. The gameplay revolves around players controlling characters that orbit planets. Players build up speed by orbiting and then launch themselves towards other planets. The objective is to collide with other players; the player with the lower velocity is eliminated from the round.

This project was originally written as a student or hobbyist project. It is currently in a functional state, but the codebase does not follow modern software engineering best practices.

## Current Status

The game is playable, but the source code is undergoing a major refactoring effort. The primary goal is to improve the codebase by applying clean code principles, improving separation of concerns, and making the software more modular, testable, and maintainable.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

### How to Compile and Run

1.  **Navigate to the Source Directory:**
    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this project where the `.java` files are located.

2.  **Compile the Code:**
    Compile all the Java source files using the following command:
    ```bash
    javac *.java
    ```

3.  **Run the Game:**
    After successful compilation, run the game using the following command:
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

This will launch the game in a fullscreen window, starting with the main menu.
